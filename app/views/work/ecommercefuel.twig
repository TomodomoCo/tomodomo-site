Andrew Youderian founded eCommerceFuel to help out his fellow online entrepreneurs. ECF is a premium forum and blog where shop owners can learn from each other and assist with finding software, service providers, and more. Members are encouraged to leave reviews on services they’ve used, ask questions of other members, and contribute their own answers and advice.

## Out With The Old

Before contacting us, eCommerceFuel was using an outdated theme on their Vanilla forums and not much in the way of additional functionality. It was definitely in need of an upgrade in order to bring Andrew’s aspirations for the community to life.

First off, a new theme to match the blog and the rest of the site was in order. Next up, an ambitious directory to track what services members were using and collect reviews together. Having a forum where members can ask each other questions can certainly get the job done, but a platform that was easily searchable and could recommend software based on what they already had would really make ECF stand out.

It was, overall, a very user-driven plan. However he also wanted some more tools for his staff to better serve and assist the community. Andrew is very focused on building a community that his members want to be a part of, and one aspect of that is a staff that can see what their members are doing and encourage reciprocity of knowledge.

Having seen [Tomodomo’s site redesign for Dynamite Circle](/work/dynamitecircle) and “doing things with Vanilla that I didn’t think [were] possible,” Andrew decided to team up with us to tackle eCommerceFuel’s upgrade.

## In With The New

After discussing with Andrew his goals for the community, we got down to work with mockups and documentation. Implementing the redesign was relatively straightforward, yet "coding creativity" was needed as there were many moving parts involved in the new features. We utilized a blended approach with WordPress and a custom app to get the best of each.

### Community Tip

Forums are the centre of most communities, but they don't have to be the only piece. Custom software add-ons give you a unique competitive edge that your competition can't easily replicate.

“The Directory” that members can search through is actually three separate directories, each allowing members to find different types of information they may need. One covers software reviews and recommendations, another is a platform for service provider reviews (web developers, graphic designers, etc), and the third is a member directory so users can find one another.

One of the most important elements was moving profile data into the custom application. We needed profile data to be searchable and wanted to merge in data from databases outside of Vanilla. Yet the data isn't accessible and has limited options for customising the appearance. So we took a unique approach and created our own infrastructure. It detected which page a user was viewing in Vanilla Forums and replaced profile pages and editing pages with custom content. We designed the editing interface to be completely seamless, as if it were native to the forums. This made it easy for users because it looked similar to the old editing pages, meaning they didn’t have to re-learn the location of their favorite options. It also helped to achieve Andrew’s goal of visual unification across the site and forums.

Another addition was email alerts for staff, providing them with information about their members as they used their forums. This new system allowed the ECF team to mark certain events - like a new member leaving a review, or asking a question - that would trigger an email to their staff that they could act on quickly and easily. Following up with new members or keeping an eye on a member’s inactivity was a key upgrade for the ECF staff, and is also a big help for community members. Staff can encourage new members to give their expertise, ask questions, or direct them toward helpful recommendations.

Throughout the redesign process, Andrew and the Tomodomo team worked together to achieve Andrew’s clear vision of the site. He enjoyed our developers’ responsiveness and suggestions. “I appreciated the fact that they would think through issues and make proactive recommendations for things that I had not thought of,” he said of the experience.

After working through difficulties that made development like “building a puzzle and solving it at the same time”, the team was able to bring the highly customized forum together in October of 2016. “There’s something really cool when we were finally able to play with it and try it out and see it working. Even me, not an eCommerce store owner, I could see the value in this and experience this for myself,” our founder, Chris, said.

## One Year Later

Now, over a year after the sweeping site changes went live, Andrew and the ECF community are pleased with the upgrade. “The community has a tighter feel, the functionality is much improved, and we’ve built up a database of thousands of reviews in the directories.” The analytical tools installed show that members have been dedicatedly using the new functionalities. Additionally, little maintenance is needed on the parts of ECF and Tomodomo. The code has stood the test of use and stayed relevant for both the members and the staff.

There’s always room for improvement and Tomodomo is always looking to help our clients continue to grow. We look forward to working with ECF in the future to bring them more advanced search functions and a further unified design.
