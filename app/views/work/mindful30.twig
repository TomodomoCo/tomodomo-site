As magazines and other print publications are looking to diversify revenue sources away from advertising, new emphasis is being placed on the age-old subscription.

**Mindful Magazine**, a leading print publication covering the burgeoning trend toward meditation, mindfulness, and mental health self-care, was looking for an opportunity to dip their toes into digital susbcriptions and paywalls. Our friends at [The Family Knife](https://www.familyknife.com/) worked with Mindful to conceive the **Mindful30** program, and chose Tomodomo to provide implementation and development services.

Mindful30 is a thirty-day mindfulness program, with daily lessons, affirmations, and training from leading experts in the mindfulness community. Content was exclusive to paid subscribers, behind a **Restrict Content Pro** paywall.

However, the word "paywall" was never used with readers. As part of Tomodomo's effort to _go beyond the paywall_, Mindful30 was marketed as an exclusive member community, with unique/you-won't-find-it-anywhere-else content anchoring the campaign. Readers received access to this exclusive content in the digital portal, and also received a one-year magazine subscription through an integration with Mindful's print fulfilment partner.

Over the initial 30-day trial campaign, the program generated **thousands of subscriptions** and **tens of thousands of dollars in new revenue**. It also generated thousands of dollars for mindfulness charities through a unique donation tool that we built.

With the success of Mindful30, we've begun work with Mindful.org to bring the paywall functionality into their primary website as part of a major website revamp, scheduled for launch in early 2018.
