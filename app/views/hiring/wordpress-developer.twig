{% markdown %}
**Van Patten Media Inc.** and **Tomodomo** are hiring a WordPress theme and/or plugin developer.

The ideal developer has extensive experience on the WordPress platform, and may also have experience with the broader modern PHP ecosystem (familiarity with Composer, Laravel, modern template engines like Twig, etc.).

This position is a contract position, for 15–20+ hours per week, paying between $35–80 per hour, based on experience and qualifications.

Tasks may include:

+ Creating a custom plugin to make API calls based on data submitted with Gravity Forms
+ Hooking into a user registration form to add additional fields
+ Building theme templates from existing HTML and CSS
+ Running site updates in a local dev environment, QA testing those updates in a remote staging environment, and deploying the changes to a remote production environment
+ Making small CSS updates (via Sass)

Bonus points if you have existing experience working with Gravity Forms, Restrict Content Pro, WooCommerce, and/or Advanced Custom Fields.

In addition to WordPress (and thus PHP) experience, it'd be great if you were comfortable in HTML and Sass/CSS, as well as modern Node.js-based tooling systems (we use Gulp).

Internally, we use GitHub, Teamwork, Google Docs, Harvest, and Slack to communicate and collaborate. Familiarity with those tools is helpful. [Learn more about what it's like to work for us.](/hiring)

Availability during at least half of US Eastern daylight hours is essential, but you don't need to be located anywhere specific.

&bullet; &bullet; &bullet;

We are hiring for all levels, but the breakdown of responsibilities will vary depending on your experience:

**Junior developers**

If you're a junior developer, expect lots of mentorship and one-on-one training. We'll work with you to get you up to speed on our workflow, expectations for code organization and styles, and we'll teach you the ropes of the various plugins and theme frameworks we use.

**Mid-level developers**

Mid-tier developers can expect similar training and mentorship, but will also be asked to share their knowledge with junior members of the team. You'll collaborate with senior members of the team and offer input on scoping and technical strategy.

**Senior developers**

As a senior developer, you'll work directly with our project manager and area directors to draw up plans and scopes for our projects, and have significant input on technical direction and strategy. You'll spend time guiding junior and mid-level developers through mentoring and code review. Expect 40–50% of your time to go toward non-coding tasks.

&bullet; &bullet; &bullet;

**Please submit to [hiring@tomodomo.co](hiring@tomodomo.co):**

+ A sample of a plugin and/or theme you've built (if available)
+ Any other relevant open source work (a GitHub link is always appreciated)
+ A cover letter, with a short description of why you choose to work with WordPress, and your experience with development outside of WordPress (or not)
+ Your desired hourly rate (or a range)
+ Any other relevant information

We'll follow up with qualified candidates to schedule a Skype interview. Please note that we cannot respond to all submissions.

We especially invite applications from members of historically under-represented groups.
