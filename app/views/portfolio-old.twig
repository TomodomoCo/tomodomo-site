We worked with Mindful, a leading magazine for mindfulness and meditation, to build Mindful30: a paid members-only platform where leading teachers and practictioners shared tips and strategies for living a more mindful life over the course of a month.

Powered by Restrict Content Pro, we used several custom plugins to power integration with Mindful\'s email marketing program, a unique charity donation option, and allow for easy exporting into their magazine fulfillment software.

In addition to building their theme and managing their large-scale WordPress installation, we worked with the team at Baton Rouge Business Report on developing a custom tool for unique infinite scrolling email newsletters.

The newsletter software allows editors to visually assemble an email of daily top stories, preview it, and send it through MailChimpâ€”all without leaving the WordPress interface. When users click through to an article, they are shown an infinite scrolling interface that automatically loads the next articles from the newsletter.
